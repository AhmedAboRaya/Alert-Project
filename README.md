I'm thrilled to announce the completion of Alert Project #1! 🎉
This enjoyable and straightforward project has taught me a lot, especially as my first step in using #React. 🚀
I also used #SASS, which enhanced the styling process significantly. 🎨
It's been a rewarding experience to see how dynamic and powerful React can be. 🌟
Looking forward to diving deeper and taking on more challenging projects! 💪

I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to Eng. Mohamed Nagaa for his effort and simplified explanation. 🙏
